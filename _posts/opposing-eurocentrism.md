## Burqa and the American flag, a tale of "double standards"
在2014年, 伊朗的女记者 Masih Alinejad 在

, launched an online campaign where she posted photos of herself without the hijab, with the Facebook page ["My Stealthy Freedom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Stealthy_Freedom). Since the 1979 Revolution, it has been illegal in Iran for women to appear in public without wearing a hijab, and thus her action inspires women across the country to post pictures of themselves without any face covering, as a signal of defiance to the regime.

Another interesting thing also happens that year. In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the [French ban on full face covering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ban_on_face_covering) passed in 2010, which was challenged and brought to the ECHR by two female Muslim protestors, Hind Ahmas and Najate Nait Ali.

No, this is **not** your "dunk on the left-wing hypocrites" kind of story. The ban, which is said to be generic and applies to all kinds of face covering, is from the very start, directly targeting the Muslim community and specifically the wearing of niqabs and burka. As it was pitched to the general public as an efficient way of countering the rise of religeous extremism and terrorism, the horrific series of terrorist attacks on French soil and around Europe proved the complete opposite. It simply didn't work.

Of course, people on different sides of the political aisle argue very differently on why the outcome of the anti-Islam sentiment post 911 is the further marginalisation of the minority Muslim community. But let's take a step back to discuss what is the reason behind the sharp contrast of the opinions towards this religeous practice from different female Muslim activists.

The key lies in the social and political context.
